                <p>Flooding is one of the most dangerous, destructive, and deadly natural disasters that can occur. They can happen anywhere, and at any time, for a variety of reasons. Flood-related deaths are common, usually due to lack of proper preparation and nonexistent safety protocols. As difficult as it may be for adults to remain safe during a flood event, it is even more so for children.</p>
